# Introduction

This project serves as a base to learn terraform. It uses GCP as the cloud provider.

## Prerequisites

A valid GCP account for adding the service account credentials in a `credentials.json` file, which is not included in the version control. The credentials are also referenced in a ignored file called `terraform.tfvars`, which will fill in the variables in `variables.tf`.
